# AnimeList-generator

This is a little project that I am doing in Javafx for my OOP class.

It basically will works in the following way: user types some data(anime name, seasons, score), the program will get this data and convert into a table in an HTML file.

You just have to download and run the AnimeList-generator.jar file here https://github.com/victor-alexandre/AnimeList-generator/tree/master/out/artifacts/AnimeList_generator_jar

PS: To run it you must have java 10 runtime enviroment installed in your computer. You can download it here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre10-downloads-4417026.html
